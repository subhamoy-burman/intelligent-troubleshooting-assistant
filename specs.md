# iTero Intelligent Troubleshooting Assistant Specification

Of course. This is a fantastic, real-world use case that perfectly illustrates the power of combining structured logic with LLMs. Building a detailed specification is the first step to success.

Here is a detailed project specification for the **iTero Intelligent Troubleshooting Assistant**.

---

### **Project Specification: iTero Intelligent Troubleshooting Assistant**

**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** June 13, 2025

#### **1. Overview & Vision**

This document outlines the design and architecture for an "Intelligent Troubleshooting Assistant" to be integrated into the iTero scanner's "Troubleshoot & Report" software module.

The vision is to create a dynamic, conversational AI agent that guides dental professionals and technicians through complex troubleshooting scenarios in real-time. By analyzing scanner-generated logs and leveraging a comprehensive knowledge base, the assistant will provide contextual, step-by-step remedies. If the automated process fails to resolve the issue, the system will seamlessly escalate by creating a formal support ticket and providing the user with immediate confirmation and follow-up details. This will reduce support call volume, decrease user downtime, and improve the overall customer experience.

The assistant is designed to engage users through a rich, continuous conversation rather than a rigid, step-by-step wizard. Users can ask follow-up questions, seek clarification, or provide additional context at any point in the troubleshooting process. All system-modifying actions will require explicit user consent before execution, empowering users while maintaining system safety.

#### **2. Key Features & Functionality**

*   **Log-Driven Analysis:** The workflow initiates by ingesting and analyzing logs directly from the iTero scanner application.
*   **Conversational Interaction:** The user interacts with the assistant via a dedicated chat interface, allowing for continuous, multi-turn dialogue. Unlike traditional troubleshooting wizards, this interface supports natural conversation, follow-up questions, and clarifications. Users can continue chatting with the application throughout the troubleshooting process.
*   **User Consent-Based Execution:** For any action that modifies the system (such as killing processes or restarting services), the assistant first explains the proposed action and requests explicit user confirmation through the UI (e.g., "Press Enter to continue"). No automated remediation steps are executed without user consent.
*   **RAG from Vector DB:** The assistant's suggestions are grounded in a knowledge base stored in a **Pinecone** vector database, ensuring answers are accurate and based on official documentation.
*   **Automated Command Execution:** The assistant can directly execute predefined remediation commands on the Windows system (e.g., terminating processes in Task Manager, restarting services) when specific error patterns are identified.
*   **Stateful Conversation:** The assistant maintains the context of the conversation, tracking which remedies have been suggested and their outcomes.
*   **Automated Escalation:** When all knowledge base remedies are exhausted and the issue persists, the system automatically creates a support ticket via a service API call.
*   **Confirmation & Closure:** Upon successful ticket creation, the user is immediately provided with a ticket number and a support callback phone number, concluding the automated interaction.

#### **3. System Architecture**

The solution will be built within the **Azure AI Foundry** ecosystem, primarily using **Prompt Flow** as the orchestration engine.

**Components:**

1.  **Scanner Application Module (Client):** The existing "Troubleshoot & Report" module on the iTero scanner. This is the user-facing component.
2.  **Azure AI Hub Project:** The central development and hosting environment for the Prompt Flow.
3.  **Prompt Flow (Chat Flow):** The core orchestration engine that defines the entire troubleshooting logic.
4.  **Azure OpenAI Service:** Provides the LLMs for reasoning, analysis, and natural language generation.
    *   **Embedding Model:** `subhamoy-text-embeddings` (for vectorizing logs and queries).
    *   **Reasoning/Chat Model:** `gpt-4o` (for complex analysis, planning, and response generation).
5.  **Pinecone Vector Database (Knowledge Base):** The long-term memory of the system.
    *   **Index:** An index named `itero-kb` containing vector embeddings of chunked troubleshooting manuals, error code descriptions, technical notes, and past resolved tickets.
    *   **Metadata:** Each vector will have associated metadata, including `source_document`, `document_section`, and a list of `error_codes` it pertains to.
    *   **Local Ingestor:** A dedicated service that monitors local project documentation and automatically updates the Pinecone index with new or modified content. For the pilot phase, this will run locally and process files directly from the project directory. In the production implementation, this would be replaced with an Azure Function triggered by Azure Blob Storage changes.
6.  **Command Execution Service:** A Windows service with elevated privileges that can execute system commands (process termination, service management, registry edits) securely via a controlled API.
7.  **Internal Ticketing System (API):** A hypothetical but representative internal service for creating support tickets.

```

#### **4. Data & Logic Flow**

The entire process will be orchestrated as a **Chat Flow** within Prompt Flow to manage conversational history automatically, taking advantage of OpenAI function calling capabilities.

1.  **Initiation:** The user clicks "Troubleshoot" in the scanner app. The app sends the recent scanner logs as the initial input to the Prompt Flow endpoint.
2.  **Log Analysis:** The flow's first step is a Python tool that pre-processes the raw logs. It extracts critical error codes, timestamps, and key status messages, summarizing them into a clean, structured "Problem Statement".
3.  **Knowledge Retrieval:** A second Python tool takes the extracted error codes and problem statement, generates an embedding using Azure OpenAI, and queries the Pinecone vector database to retrieve a list of the top 3-5 most relevant troubleshooting guide chunks.
4.  **Stateful Interaction Loop (Core of the Chat Flow):**
    a.  A GPT-4o-enabled LLM tool (`State_Manager_LLM`) analyzes the current `chat_history`, the original problem statement, and the full list of retrieved knowledge base steps.
    b.  Its primary job is to decide the `next_action` using a function-calling approach where the model explicitly selects from a set of defined tools.
    c.  The following function tools are defined in the model's system message:
        *   `suggest_remedy`: When there are untried steps in the knowledge base. Parameters include `remedy_text` (the exact text of the remedy to suggest) and `expected_outcome` (what should happen if the remedy is successful).
        *   `execute_command`: When an automated command sequence is available. Parameters include `command_id`, `params` (command parameters as a JSON object), and `request_consent` (boolean, defaulting to true for system-modifying actions).
        *   `request_clarification`: When the user's response is ambiguous. Parameters include `question` (the clarification question to ask).
        *   `create_support_ticket`: When all remedies have been exhausted. Parameters include `reason` (why escalation is needed) and `troubleshooting_summary` (summary of attempts made).
    d.  The LLM makes an explicit function call based on the MSDR reasoning process, which is then routed to the appropriate tool.
5.  **Automated Tool Execution (Function Calling Pattern):**
    a.  Instead of conditional activation, the pattern uses parallel function calling capabilities of GPT-4o to determine which functions should be executed.
    b.  Each defined function corresponds to a Python tool in the Prompt Flow that implements the required logic.
    c.  This approach allows for more dynamic interaction and potential parallel execution of compatible functions.
    d.  When GPT-4o determines a command needs to be executed, the `execute_command` function is called, which maps to the Command Execution Service.
6.  **Command Execution Service Integration:**
    a.  A Python tool (`Execute_Command_Python`) is triggered when the `execute_command` function is called.
    b.  It interfaces with the Windows-based Command Execution Service to run predefined command sequences.
    c.  Each command sequence has a unique `command_id` that maps to a predefined script or command template.
    d.  The tool enforces user consent for system-modifying actions.
7.  **Ticketing System Integration:**
    a.  A Python tool (`Create_Support_Ticket_Python`) is triggered when the `create_support_ticket` function is called.
    b.  It makes a `POST` request to the internal ticketing system API, sending the problem statement and conversation history.
    c.  It returns ticket information to be included in the response to the user.
8.  **Response Generation:**
    a.  The function call results are sent back to the LLM along with the conversation history.
    b.  The LLM then generates a natural language response incorporating the results of the function calls.
    c.  This allows for complex multi-function scenarios where multiple tools might be invoked in a single interaction.
9.  **Output:** The flow's `chat_output` is the formatted message, which is displayed to the user in the scanner's chat interface.

#### **5. Chain of Thought (CoT) Pattern: Multi-Stage Diagnostic Reasoning**

The iTero Intelligent Troubleshooting Assistant will implement a structured Chain of Thought (CoT) pattern specifically designed for diagnostic reasoning. This pattern, named "Multi-Stage Diagnostic Reasoning" (MSDR), guides the LLM through a series of explicit reasoning steps before proposing actions or responses to the user.

**Pattern Structure:**

1. **Observation Stage**: The LLM analyzes raw data (logs, user descriptions) to identify key signals.
   - Extract error codes, timestamps, sequences, and patterns
   - Identify conflicting or anomalous signals
   - Formulate initial hypotheses about what might be happening

2. **Knowledge Integration Stage**: The LLM combines domain knowledge with observations.
   - Map error codes to known issues in the knowledge base
   - Identify relevant troubleshooting procedures
   - Assess the applicability of each procedure to the current scenario
   - Identify gaps in the current understanding

3. **Reasoning Stage**: The LLM evaluates potential diagnoses and solution paths.
   - Rank hypotheses by likelihood based on evidence
   - Consider causal relationships between symptoms
   - Evaluate previous remediation attempts and their outcomes
   - Generate predictions about what would happen if each solution were applied
   - Identify potential unintended consequences of each solution

4. **Action Planning Stage**: The LLM determines the next best step.
   - Select the most appropriate next action (suggest remedy, execute command, escalate)
   - Detail exactly how the action should be performed
   - Explain why this action is preferable to alternatives
   - Predict what information will be gained from the action

5. **Communication Stage**: The LLM prepares user-facing communication.
   - Simplify technical details for clarity
   - Provide context for why the action is recommended
   - Set appropriate expectations for outcomes
   - Ensure consent is requested when system changes are needed

**Implementation in Prompt Flow:**

This CoT pattern will be explicitly encoded in the system prompt for the State_Manager_LLM node. The prompt will instruct the model to follow these five stages of reasoning before outputting its final decision JSON. Each stage's reasoning will be captured in the logs for debugging, but only the final communication will be shown to users.

The system prompt will include explicit instructions to "think step by step" through each of these stages, with dedicated sections for the model to document its reasoning at each stage.

This structured approach offers several benefits:
- Improves diagnostic accuracy by forcing systematic consideration of evidence
- Creates traceable reasoning paths for QA and debugging
- Reduces "hallucination" by grounding reasoning in specific observations and knowledge
- Maintains consistent reasoning patterns across different troubleshooting scenarios
- Allows for targeted improvement of specific reasoning stages

**Integration with Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning:**

The MSDR pattern will be implemented using a hybrid approach combining zero-shot and few-shot learning techniques:

1. **Zero-Shot Learning Applications:**
   - Initial error code categorization and classification
   - Simple diagnostic scenarios with clear patterns
   - Selection of appropriate troubleshooting domains
   - Relevance assessment for retrieved knowledge base content
   - Binary decision points (e.g., should a command be executed?)
   - Novel error patterns not previously encountered

2. **Few-Shot Learning Applications:**
   - Complex diagnostic reasoning chains for known error patterns
   - Multi-factor troubleshooting scenarios
   - Distinguishing between similar but distinct error causes
   - Command selection and parameter preparation
   - Action prioritization when multiple potential solutions exist
   - Formatting user-facing communications for clarity and comprehension

3. **Hybrid Implementation Strategy:**
   - Start with zero-shot for efficiency in the Observation and initial Knowledge Integration stages
   - Apply few-shot examples when entering the Reasoning and Action Planning stages for complex issues
   - Use few-shot with 2-3 carefully selected examples that best match the current scenario
   - Dynamically adjust the number of examples based on error complexity and detection confidence
   - Maintain a library of high-quality examples organized by error categories, components, and resolution patterns
   - Regularly update examples based on successful troubleshooting interactions

    system:
    You are a sophisticated troubleshooting state manager for iTero scanners. Your role is to decide the next action in a troubleshooting conversation using OpenAI function calling capabilities.
    
    You have access to the following tools through function calling:
    
    # Available Functions
    You can call the following functions:
    
    1. suggest_remedy(remedy_text: str, expected_outcome: str)
    - Use when there are untried steps in the knowledge base that the user should manually perform
    - remedy_text: The exact text of the remedy to suggest to the user, including step-by-step instructions
    - expected_outcome: What should happen if the remedy is successful
    
    2. execute_command(command_id: str, params: object, request_consent: bool = true)
    - Use when an automated command sequence is available that can be executed by the system
    - command_id: The identifier for the predefined command to execute (e.g., "kill_process", "restart_service")
    - params: Parameters required for the command as a JSON object (e.g., {"process_name": "iTeroScannerService.exe"})
    - request_consent: Whether user consent should be requested before execution (default to true for system-modifying actions)
    
    3. request_clarification(question: str)
    - Use when the user's response is ambiguous or more information is needed
    - question: The specific question to ask the user to clarify their response or provide more details
    
    4. create_support_ticket(reason: str, troubleshooting_summary: str)
    - Use when all remedies have been exhausted or the issue requires human support
    - reason: Why escalation is needed (e.g., "All remedies attempted without success")
    - troubleshooting_summary: A concise summary of all troubleshooting steps attempted and their outcomes
    
    You must follow a structured Chain of Thought approach called "Multi-Stage Diagnostic Reasoning" (MSDR) with these five stages:
    
    1. OBSERVATION STAGE:
    - Analyze raw logs and user descriptions to identify key signals
    - Extract relevant error codes, timestamps, sequences, and patterns
    - Identify conflicting or anomalous signals
    - Formulate initial hypotheses
    
    2. KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION STAGE:
    - Map error codes to known issues in the knowledge base
    - Identify relevant troubleshooting procedures
    - Assess the applicability of each procedure to the current scenario
    - Identify gaps in current understanding
    
    3. REASONING STAGE:
    - Rank hypotheses by likelihood based on evidence
    - Consider causal relationships between symptoms
    - Evaluate previous remediation attempts and outcomes
    - Generate predictions about what would happen if each solution were applied
    - Identify potential unintended consequences
    
    4. ACTION PLANNING STAGE:
    - Select the most appropriate next action
    - Detail exactly how the action should be performed
    - Explain why this action is preferable to alternatives
    - Predict what information will be gained from the action
    
    5. COMMUNICATION STAGE:
    - Simplify technical details for clarity
    - Provide context for why the action is recommended
    - Set appropriate expectations for outcomes
    - Ensure consent is requested when system changes are needed
    
    After completing all five stages, you MUST call one of the available functions to determine the next action in the troubleshooting flow.
    
    # Implementation of Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning
    
    Your reasoning process should use a hybrid approach:
    
    1. Zero-Shot Learning:
      - Use for initial error code categorization and classification
      - Apply to simple diagnostic scenarios with clear patterns
      - Use for relevance assessment of retrieved knowledge base content
      - Apply for binary decision points (e.g., should a command be executed?)
      - Use when encountering novel error patterns not in examples
    
    2. Few-Shot Learning:
      - Apply for complex diagnostic reasoning chains using the examples below
      - Use when handling multi-factor troubleshooting scenarios
      - Apply when distinguishing between similar but distinct error causes
      - Use for command selection and parameter preparation
      - Apply when prioritizing actions with multiple potential solutions
    
    Here are examples of how to apply the MSDR framework to different scanner issues:
    
    EXAMPLE 1:
    Problem: The scanner fails to connect to the network with error code 3045. The scanner shows "Network Connection Failed" message.
    Error Codes: 3045
    Affected Components: ["network", "wifi adapter"]
    Severity: medium
    Retrieved Knowledge Base:
    - KB1: Error 3045 indicates WiFi driver issues. Try restarting the WiFi adapter.
    - KB2: Network connection failures can be caused by incorrect network settings.
    
    Multi-Stage Diagnostic Reasoning:
    
    1. OBSERVATION STAGE:
    Error code 3045 indicates a network connection failure. The error specifically points to WiFi connectivity issues. There are no conflicting signals in the logs. Initial hypothesis: Scanner's WiFi adapter or its driver is malfunctioning.
    
    2. KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION STAGE:
    Knowledge base entry KB1 directly maps to error code 3045 and suggests WiFi driver issues. KB1 recommends restarting the WiFi adapter as a solution. KB2 is relevant but less specific to the error code.
    
    3. REASONING STAGE:
    Most likely cause: WiFi adapter driver issue. Restarting the adapter is a simple, non-invasive troubleshooting step with high success probability for driver issues. Alternative hypotheses like incorrect network settings are less likely based on the specific error code.
    
    4. ACTION PLANNING STAGE:
    Recommend restarting the WiFi adapter as suggested in KB1. This action is preferable because it's non-invasive, quick to implement, and addresses the most likely cause. This will help determine if the issue is transient or persistent.
    
    5. COMMUNICATION STAGE:
    Provide clear instructions on restarting the WiFi adapter in simple terms. Explain that this is a common solution for connectivity issues and sets proper expectations about the outcome.
    
    Function Call:
    suggest_remedy(
      remedy_text="Your scanner is having trouble connecting to the network. Let's try restarting the WiFi adapter: 1) Go to Settings > Network on your scanner's touchscreen. 2) Toggle the WiFi switch off. 3) Wait 10 seconds. 4) Toggle the WiFi switch back on. Please let me know if this resolves the connection issue.",
      expected_outcome="WiFi connection is re-established and scanner can connect to the network"
    )
    
    EXAMPLE 2:
    Problem: Scanner calibration fails with error code 5001. Process iTeroScannerService.exe is not responding.
    Error Codes: 5001
    Affected Components: ["iTeroScannerService.exe", "calibration module"]
    Severity: high
    Retrieved Knowledge Base:
    - KB3: Error 5001 often indicates the scanner service has crashed or is unresponsive. Terminating and restarting the process usually resolves this.
    - KB4: Calibration failures may be related to outdated firmware.
    Conversation history shows user already tried turning the scanner off and on without success.
    
    Multi-Stage Diagnostic Reasoning:
    
    1. OBSERVATION STAGE:
    Error code 5001 indicates that iTeroScannerService.exe is not responding, preventing calibration. User has already attempted a full restart without success, suggesting a persistent issue with the service.
    
    2. KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION STAGE:
    KB3 directly addresses error 5001 and suggests terminating and restarting the specific process. KB4 mentions firmware but is less relevant to the immediate issue.
    
    3. REASONING STAGE:
    The most likely cause is a hung process that wasn't properly terminated during the restart. Since a full system restart didn't resolve the issue, a targeted process termination is needed. This has a high probability of success based on the knowledge base.
    
    4. ACTION PLANNING STAGE:
    Execute command to terminate the problematic process. This requires elevated permissions, so user consent is mandatory. This is preferable to suggesting another restart since that was already attempted without success.
    
    5. COMMUNICATION STAGE:
    Clearly explain what process needs to be terminated, why, and that this requires permission. Set expectations about the need to recalibrate afterward.
    
    Function Call:
    execute_command(
      command_id="kill_process",
      params={"process_name": "iTeroScannerService.exe"},
      request_consent=true
    )
    
    EXAMPLE 3:
    Problem: Scanner shows error code 7512 during scan upload.
    Error Codes: 7512
    Affected Components: ["cloud upload", "network"]
    Severity: medium
    Retrieved Knowledge Base:
    No specific entries found for error code 7512.
    Conversation history shows multiple issues reported by user with inconsistent descriptions.
    
    Multi-Stage Diagnostic Reasoning:
    
    1. OBSERVATION STAGE:
    Error code 7512 is not documented in our knowledge base. User reports are inconsistent and lack specificity about the exact circumstances when the upload fails.
    
    2. KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION STAGE:
    No direct knowledge base entries for this error code. Need more information from the user about the context and any error messages displayed.
    
    3. REASONING STAGE:
    Without specific information about when the error occurs and what the user sees on screen, it's difficult to narrow down the cause of the upload failure.
    
    4. ACTION PLANNING STAGE:
    Request clarification from the user to get more specific details about when the error occurs and what they see on the screen.
    
    5. COMMUNICATION STAGE:
    Ask specific, targeted questions that will help identify the root cause of the upload issue.
    
    Function Call:
    request_clarification(
      question="To help troubleshoot the upload error (code 7512), could you please tell me: 1) At what point during the upload process does the error occur? 2) Is there any specific error message shown on the screen besides the error code? 3) Have uploads worked successfully in the past from this scanner?"
    )
    
    EXAMPLE 4:
    Problem: The scanner is showing multiple error codes and has been unresponsive for hours.
    Error Codes: [3045, 5001, 6723]
    Affected Components: ["system", "network", "calibration"]
    Severity: high
    Retrieved Knowledge Base:
    - KB1: Error 3045 indicates WiFi driver issues. Try restarting the WiFi adapter.
    - KB3: Error 5001 often indicates the scanner service has crashed or is unresponsive.
    Conversation history shows user has attempted all suggested remedies without success.
    
    Multi-Stage Diagnostic Reasoning:
    
    1. OBSERVATION STAGE:
    Multiple critical error codes indicate a system-wide failure across multiple components. The scanner has been unresponsive for hours despite restart attempts.
    
    2. KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION STAGE:
    Knowledge base entries exist for some errors but not the combination of all three. The multiple errors suggest a possible hardware failure or severe system corruption. All software-based remediation steps have been exhausted.
    
    3. REASONING STAGE:
    The combination of network, service, and calibration errors suggests a possible hardware failure or severe system corruption. All software-based remediation steps have been exhausted.
    
    4. ACTION PLANNING STAGE:
    Create a support ticket as all knowledge base remedies have been exhausted and the issue persists. The combination of errors requires technical support intervention.
    
    5. COMMUNICATION STAGE:
    Explain to the user that advanced technical support is needed and a ticket will be created.
    
    Function Call:
    create_support_ticket(
      reason="Multiple critical errors across system components with all remedies exhausted",
      troubleshooting_summary="User reported errors 3045, 5001, and 6723 affecting network, system services, and calibration. WiFi restart and service restart were attempted without success. Scanner remains unresponsive for extended period."

#### **7. Azure OpenAI Monitoring & Request Filtering**

To ensure optimal performance, security, and cost management of the Azure OpenAI service used in this solution, a comprehensive monitoring and request filtering strategy will be implemented. This strategy addresses the need to monitor and filter high-volume requests by client ID, IP, or machine.

**Components:**

1. **Client/Machine Identification System:**
   * Each scanner device will be assigned a unique `client_id` included in all API requests to Azure OpenAI.
   * The `user` parameter in Azure OpenAI API requests will include this client identifier in the format: `scanner_id:location_id:serial_number`.
   * Optional custom headers will include additional metadata like scanner model, software version, and last maintenance date.

2. **Azure Monitor Diagnostic Settings:**
   * Configure diagnostic settings for the Azure OpenAI service to route logs to Azure Log Analytics workspace.
   * Enable collection of the following log categories:
     * `RequestResponse`: Captures full request/response pairs with client identifiers
     * `Trace`: Captures detailed diagnostic information
     * `AuditEvent`: Captures management operations
   * Enable all metrics for token usage, request volumes, and latency tracking.

3. **Log Analytics Workspace:**
   * A dedicated Log Analytics workspace will store and process logs from the Azure OpenAI service.
   * Retention period set to 90 days for operational data and 2 years for compliance/audit data.
   * Implement custom Kusto query library for common monitoring scenarios.

4. **Azure Monitor Alerts:**
   * Set up the following alert types:
     * **Token consumption**: Alert when approaching quota limits (80% threshold)
     * **Request volume**: Alert on unusual increases in requests (>50% from baseline)
     * **Client-specific**: Alert when a single client/machine exceeds predetermined thresholds
     * **Error rate**: Alert when error rates exceed 5% of total requests
     * **Latency**: Alert when response times exceed 5 seconds for non-complex prompts

5. **Request Filtering & Rate Limiting Strategy:**
   * **Azure API Management layer** will be deployed in front of the Azure OpenAI service to:
     * Apply per-client rate limiting based on scanner ID
     * Apply IP-based throttling to prevent abuse
     * Filter requests based on content and size
     * Cache responses when appropriate to reduce token usage
     * Apply custom header validation

6. **Client-Side Throttling:**
   * Implement exponential backoff retry logic in scanner application for 429 responses
   * Local token counting to avoid exceeding quotas
   * Local rate limiter to maintain maximum requests per minute per device
   * Circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures

7. **Monitoring Dashboard:**
   * Create an Azure dashboard with the following visualizations:
     * Token usage by model, client, and time period
     * Request volume by client ID and geographic region
     * Error rates and types
     * Response latency trends
     * Quota utilization and forecasting

**Kusto Queries for Common Monitoring Scenarios:**

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Configure Azure OpenAI diagnostic settings to send logs to Log Analytics
2. Set up Azure API Management service as a gateway for the Azure OpenAI endpoint
3. Configure rate limiting policies in API Management based on client identification
4. Update the scanner application to include client identifiers in requests
5. Create Azure Monitor alert rules for the defined thresholds
6. Implement client-side throttling and retry logic
7. Deploy the monitoring dashboard
8. Document the monitoring and filtering procedures for operations teams

This monitoring and filtering system will enable effective tracking of Azure OpenAI usage across all scanner devices, identification of problematic usage patterns, and automated enforcement of usage policies to control costs and ensure service availability for all users.

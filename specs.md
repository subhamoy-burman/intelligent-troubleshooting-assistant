# iTero Intelligent Troubleshooting Assistant Specification

Of course. This is a fantastic, real-world use case that perfectly illustrates the power of combining structured logic with LLMs. Building a detailed specification is the first step to success.

Here is a detailed project specification for the **iTero Intelligent Troubleshooting Assistant**.

---

### **Project Specification: iTero Intelligent Troubleshooting Assistant**

**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** June 13, 2025

#### **1. Overview & Vision**

This document outlines the design and architecture for an "Intelligent Troubleshooting Assistant" to be integrated into the iTero scanner's "Troubleshoot & Report" software module.

The vision is to create a dynamic, conversational AI agent that guides dental professionals and technicians through complex troubleshooting scenarios in real-time. By analyzing scanner-generated logs and leveraging a comprehensive knowledge base, the assistant will provide contextual, step-by-step remedies. If the automated process fails to resolve the issue, the system will seamlessly escalate by creating a formal support ticket and providing the user with immediate confirmation and follow-up details. This will reduce support call volume, decrease user downtime, and improve the overall customer experience.

The assistant is designed to engage users through a rich, continuous conversation rather than a rigid, step-by-step wizard. Users can ask follow-up questions, seek clarification, or provide additional context at any point in the troubleshooting process. All system-modifying actions will require explicit user consent before execution, empowering users while maintaining system safety.

#### **2. Key Features & Functionality**

*   **Log-Driven Analysis:** The workflow initiates by ingesting and analyzing logs directly from the iTero scanner application.
*   **Conversational Interaction:** The user interacts with the assistant via a dedicated chat interface, allowing for continuous, multi-turn dialogue. Unlike traditional troubleshooting wizards, this interface supports natural conversation, follow-up questions, and clarifications. Users can continue chatting with the application throughout the troubleshooting process.
*   **User Consent-Based Execution:** For any action that modifies the system (such as killing processes or restarting services), the assistant first explains the proposed action and requests explicit user confirmation through the UI (e.g., "Press Enter to continue"). No automated remediation steps are executed without user consent.
*   **RAG from Vector DB:** The assistant's suggestions are grounded in a knowledge base stored in a **Pinecone** vector database, ensuring answers are accurate and based on official documentation.
*   **Automated Command Execution:** The assistant can directly execute predefined remediation commands on the Windows system (e.g., terminating processes in Task Manager, restarting services) when specific error patterns are identified.
*   **Stateful Conversation:** The assistant maintains the context of the conversation, tracking which remedies have been suggested and their outcomes.
*   **Automated Escalation:** When all knowledge base remedies are exhausted and the issue persists, the system automatically creates a support ticket via a service API call.
*   **Confirmation & Closure:** Upon successful ticket creation, the user is immediately provided with a ticket number and a support callback phone number, concluding the automated interaction.

#### **3. System Architecture**

The solution will be built within the **Azure AI Foundry** ecosystem, primarily using **Prompt Flow** as the orchestration engine.

**Components:**

1.  **Scanner Application Module (Client):** The existing "Troubleshoot & Report" module on the iTero scanner. This is the user-facing component.
2.  **Azure AI Hub Project:** The central development and hosting environment for the Prompt Flow.
3.  **Prompt Flow (Chat Flow):** The core orchestration engine that defines the entire troubleshooting logic.
4.  **Azure OpenAI Service:** Provides the LLMs for reasoning, analysis, and natural language generation.
    *   **Embedding Model:** `subhamoy-text-embeddings` (for vectorizing logs and queries).
    *   **Reasoning/Chat Model:** `gpt-4o` (for complex analysis, planning, and response generation).
5.  **Pinecone Vector Database (Knowledge Base):** The long-term memory of the system.
    *   **Index:** An index named `itero-kb` containing vector embeddings of chunked troubleshooting manuals, error code descriptions, technical notes, and past resolved tickets.
    *   **Metadata:** Each vector will have associated metadata, including `source_document`, `document_section`, and a list of `error_codes` it pertains to.
    *   **Local Ingestor:** A dedicated service that monitors local project documentation and automatically updates the Pinecone index with new or modified content. For the pilot phase, this will run locally and process files directly from the project directory. In the production implementation, this would be replaced with an Azure Function triggered by Azure Blob Storage changes.
6.  **Command Execution Service:** A Windows service with elevated privileges that can execute system commands (process termination, service management, registry edits) securely via a controlled API.
7.  **Internal Ticketing System (API):** A hypothetical but representative internal service for creating support tickets.

```

#### **4. Data & Logic Flow**

The entire process will be orchestrated as a **Chat Flow** within Prompt Flow to manage conversational history automatically.

1.  **Initiation:** The user clicks "Troubleshoot" in the scanner app. The app sends the recent scanner logs as the initial input to the Prompt Flow endpoint.
2.  **Log Analysis:** The flow's first step is a Python tool that pre-processes the raw logs. It extracts critical error codes, timestamps, and key status messages, summarizing them into a clean, structured "Problem Statement".
3.  **Knowledge Retrieval:** A second Python tool takes the extracted error codes and problem statement, generates an embedding using Azure OpenAI, and queries the Pinecone vector database to retrieve a list of the top 3-5 most relevant troubleshooting guide chunks.
4.  **Stateful Interaction Loop (Core of the Chat Flow):**
    a.  An LLM tool (`State_Manager_LLM`) analyzes the current `chat_history`, the original problem statement, and the full list of retrieved knowledge base steps.
    b.  Its primary job is to decide the `next_action`. The prompt will instruct it to output a JSON object like `{"action": "ACTION_TYPE", "details": "..."}`.
    c.  Possible `ACTION_TYPE` values are:
        *   `SUGGEST_REMEDY`: If there are untried steps in the knowledge base. The `details` will contain the text of the next remedy to suggest.
        *   `EXECUTE_COMMAND`: If the knowledge base indicates an automated command sequence is available for the error. The `details` will contain a command_id and any parameters.
        *   `AWAITING_USER_FEEDBACK`: After a remedy has been suggested.
        *   `ALL_STEPS_EXHAUSTED`: If the user has confirmed that all relevant remedies from the knowledge base have failed.
        *   `CLARIFY`: If the user's response is ambiguous.
    d.  This decision is passed to the next nodes.
5.  **Automated Command Execution (Conditional Logic):**
    a.  A Python tool (`Execute_Command_Python`) is configured with a conditional `Activate config`.
    b.  **Condition:** `when ${State_Manager_LLM.output.action} == "EXECUTE_COMMAND"`
    c.  This tool interfaces with the Command Execution Service to run predefined command sequences, such as terminating specific processes in Task Manager.
    d.  Each command sequence has a unique `command_id` that maps to a predefined script or command template.
6.  **Automated Escalation (Conditional Logic):**
    a.  A Python tool (`Create_Support_Ticket_Python`) is configured with a conditional `Activate config`.
    b.  **Condition:** `when ${State_Manager_LLM.output.action} == "ALL_STEPS_EXHAUSTED"`
    c.  This tool makes a `POST` request to the internal ticketing system API, sending the problem statement and conversation history.
7.  **Response Generation:**
    a.  A final Python tool (`Format_Final_Response_Python`) constructs the message to send back to the user.
    b.  If the next action is `SUGGEST_REMEDY`, it formats the suggestion clearly.
    c.  If a ticket was created (i.e., the `Create_Support_Ticket_Python` node ran and returned a ticket ID), it formats the confirmation message with the ticket number and callback details.
8.  **Output:** The flow's `chat_output` is the formatted message, which is displayed to the user in the scanner's chat interface.

#### **5. Chain of Thought (CoT) Pattern: Multi-Stage Diagnostic Reasoning**

The iTero Intelligent Troubleshooting Assistant will implement a structured Chain of Thought (CoT) pattern specifically designed for diagnostic reasoning. This pattern, named "Multi-Stage Diagnostic Reasoning" (MSDR), guides the LLM through a series of explicit reasoning steps before proposing actions or responses to the user.

**Pattern Structure:**

1. **Observation Stage**: The LLM analyzes raw data (logs, user descriptions) to identify key signals.
   - Extract error codes, timestamps, sequences, and patterns
   - Identify conflicting or anomalous signals
   - Formulate initial hypotheses about what might be happening

2. **Knowledge Integration Stage**: The LLM combines domain knowledge with observations.
   - Map error codes to known issues in the knowledge base
   - Identify relevant troubleshooting procedures
   - Assess the applicability of each procedure to the current scenario
   - Identify gaps in the current understanding

3. **Reasoning Stage**: The LLM evaluates potential diagnoses and solution paths.
   - Rank hypotheses by likelihood based on evidence
   - Consider causal relationships between symptoms
   - Evaluate previous remediation attempts and their outcomes
   - Generate predictions about what would happen if each solution were applied
   - Identify potential unintended consequences of each solution

4. **Action Planning Stage**: The LLM determines the next best step.
   - Select the most appropriate next action (suggest remedy, execute command, escalate)
   - Detail exactly how the action should be performed
   - Explain why this action is preferable to alternatives
   - Predict what information will be gained from the action

5. **Communication Stage**: The LLM prepares user-facing communication.
   - Simplify technical details for clarity
   - Provide context for why the action is recommended
   - Set appropriate expectations for outcomes
   - Ensure consent is requested when system changes are needed

**Implementation in Prompt Flow:**

This CoT pattern will be explicitly encoded in the system prompt for the State_Manager_LLM node. The prompt will instruct the model to follow these five stages of reasoning before outputting its final decision JSON. Each stage's reasoning will be captured in the logs for debugging, but only the final communication will be shown to users.

The system prompt will include explicit instructions to "think step by step" through each of these stages, with dedicated sections for the model to document its reasoning at each stage.

This structured approach offers several benefits:
- Improves diagnostic accuracy by forcing systematic consideration of evidence
- Creates traceable reasoning paths for QA and debugging
- Reduces "hallucination" by grounding reasoning in specific observations and knowledge
- Maintains consistent reasoning patterns across different troubleshooting scenarios
- Allows for targeted improvement of specific reasoning stages

**Integration with Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning:**

The MSDR pattern will be implemented using a hybrid approach combining zero-shot and few-shot learning techniques:

1. **Zero-Shot Learning Applications:**
   - Initial error code categorization and classification
   - Simple diagnostic scenarios with clear patterns
   - Selection of appropriate troubleshooting domains
   - Relevance assessment for retrieved knowledge base content
   - Binary decision points (e.g., should a command be executed?)
   - Novel error patterns not previously encountered

2. **Few-Shot Learning Applications:**
   - Complex diagnostic reasoning chains for known error patterns
   - Multi-factor troubleshooting scenarios
   - Distinguishing between similar but distinct error causes
   - Command selection and parameter preparation
   - Action prioritization when multiple potential solutions exist
   - Formatting user-facing communications for clarity and comprehension

3. **Hybrid Implementation Strategy:**
   - Start with zero-shot for efficiency in the Observation and initial Knowledge Integration stages
   - Apply few-shot examples when entering the Reasoning and Action Planning stages for complex issues
   - Use few-shot with 2-3 carefully selected examples that best match the current scenario
   - Dynamically adjust the number of examples based on error complexity and detection confidence
   - Maintain a library of high-quality examples organized by error categories, components, and resolution patterns
   - Regularly update examples based on successful troubleshooting interactions

    system:
    You are a sophisticated troubleshooting state manager for iTero scanners. Your role is to decide the next action in a troubleshooting conversation.
    
    You must follow a structured Chain of Thought approach called "Multi-Stage Diagnostic Reasoning" (MSDR) with these five stages:
    
    1. OBSERVATION STAGE:
    - Analyze raw logs and user descriptions to identify key signals
    - Extract relevant error codes, timestamps, sequences, and patterns
    - Identify conflicting or anomalous signals
    - Formulate initial hypotheses
    
    2. KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION STAGE:
    - Map error codes to known issues in the knowledge base
    - Identify relevant troubleshooting procedures
    - Assess the applicability of each procedure to the current scenario
    - Identify gaps in current understanding
    
    3. REASONING STAGE:
    - Rank hypotheses by likelihood based on evidence
    - Consider causal relationships between symptoms
    - Evaluate previous remediation attempts and outcomes
    - Generate predictions about what would happen if each solution were applied
    - Identify potential unintended consequences
    
    4. ACTION PLANNING STAGE:
    - Select the most appropriate next action
    - Detail exactly how the action should be performed
    - Explain why this action is preferable to alternatives
    - Predict what information will be gained from the action
    
    5. COMMUNICATION STAGE:
    - Simplify technical details for clarity
    - Provide context for why the action is recommended
    - Set appropriate expectations for outcomes
    - Ensure consent is requested when system changes are needed
    
    After completing all five stages, your output MUST be a single, valid JSON object with the keys "action" and "details".
    Possible values for "action" are: "SUGGEST_REMEDY", "EXECUTE_COMMAND", "ALL_STEPS_EXHAUSTED", "CLARIFY".
    
    - If suggesting a remedy, "details" should contain the exact text of the remedy to provide to the user.
    - If executing a command, "details" should be a JSON object with "command_id", "params", and "request_consent" fields. Always set "request_consent" to true for any system-modifying commands.
    - If all steps are exhausted, "details" should be "All knowledge base steps have been attempted."
    - If clarifying, "details" should contain the question to ask the user.
    
    Here are examples of how to apply the MSDR framework to different scanner issues:
    
    EXAMPLE 1:
    Problem: The scanner fails to connect to the network with error code 3045. The scanner shows "Network Connection Failed" message.
    Error Codes: 3045
    Affected Components: ["network", "wifi adapter"]
    Severity: medium
    Retrieved Knowledge Base:
    - KB1: Error 3045 indicates WiFi driver issues. Try restarting the WiFi adapter.
    - KB2: Network connection failures can be caused by incorrect network settings.
    
    Multi-Stage Diagnostic Reasoning:
    
    1. OBSERVATION STAGE:
    Error code 3045 indicates a network connection failure. The error specifically points to WiFi connectivity issues. There are no conflicting signals in the logs. Initial hypothesis: Scanner's WiFi adapter or its driver is malfunctioning.
    
    2. KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION STAGE:
    Knowledge base entry KB1 directly maps to error code 3045 and suggests WiFi driver issues. KB1 recommends restarting the WiFi adapter as a solution. KB2 is relevant but less specific to the error code.
    
    3. REASONING STAGE:
    Most likely cause: WiFi adapter driver issue. Restarting the adapter is a simple, non-invasive troubleshooting step with high success probability for driver issues. Alternative hypotheses like incorrect network settings are less likely based on the specific error code.
    
    4. ACTION PLANNING STAGE:
    Recommend restarting the WiFi adapter as suggested in KB1. This action is preferable because it's non-invasive, quick to implement, and addresses the most likely cause. This will help determine if the issue is transient or persistent.
    
    5. COMMUNICATION STAGE:
    Provide clear instructions on restarting the WiFi adapter in simple terms. Explain that this is a common solution for connectivity issues and sets proper expectations about the outcome.
    
    Final Decision:
    {"action": "SUGGEST_REMEDY", "details": "Your scanner is having trouble connecting to the network. Let's try restarting the WiFi adapter: 1) Go to Settings > Network on your scanner's touchscreen. 2) Toggle the WiFi switch off. 3) Wait 10 seconds. 4) Toggle the WiFi switch back on. Please let me know if this resolves the connection issue."}
    
    EXAMPLE 2:
    Problem: Scanner calibration fails with error code 5001. Process iTeroScannerService.exe is not responding.
    Error Codes: 5001
    Affected Components: ["iTeroScannerService.exe", "calibration module"]
    Severity: high
    Retrieved Knowledge Base:
    - KB3: Error 5001 often indicates the scanner service has crashed or is unresponsive. Terminating and restarting the process usually resolves this.
    - KB4: Calibration failures may be related to outdated firmware.
    Conversation history shows user already tried turning the scanner off and on without success.
    
    Multi-Stage Diagnostic Reasoning:
    
    1. OBSERVATION STAGE:
    Error code 5001 indicates that iTeroScannerService.exe is not responding, preventing calibration. User has already attempted a full restart without success, suggesting a persistent issue with the service.
    
    2. KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION STAGE:
    KB3 directly addresses error 5001 and suggests terminating and restarting the specific process. KB4 mentions firmware but is less relevant to the immediate issue.
    
    3. REASONING STAGE:
    The most likely cause is a hung process that wasn't properly terminated during the restart. Since a full system restart didn't resolve the issue, a targeted process termination is needed. This has a high probability of success based on the knowledge base.
    
    4. ACTION PLANNING STAGE:
    Execute command to terminate the problematic process. This requires elevated permissions, so user consent is mandatory. This is preferable to suggesting another restart since that was already attempted without success.
    
    5. COMMUNICATION STAGE:
    Clearly explain what process needs to be terminated, why, and that this requires permission. Set expectations about the need to recalibrate afterward.
    
    Final Decision:
    {"action": "EXECUTE_COMMAND", "details": {"command_id": "kill_process", "params": {"process_name": "iTeroScannerService.exe"}, "request_consent": true}}

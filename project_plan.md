## Decision Points and Questions

Throughout the project, several key decisions will need to be made that may require stakeholder input:

1. **Knowledge Base Scope**: What is the initial scope of troubleshooting content to be included? Should we prioritize certain error categories?

2. **Command Execution Permissions**: What level of system access is appropriate for the Command Execution Service? Should we implement role-based access control?

3. **Local Ingestion Implementation**: What is the best way to implement the local document monitoring system for the pilot project? How frequently should it check for changes?

4. **Azure Migration Plan**: What is the timeline for transitioning from the local ingestion system to an Azure Blob Storage/Functions-based approach after the pilot phase? What additional features should be included in this transition?

5. **Multi-Stage Diagnostic Reasoning Implementation**: 
   - How should we balance the thoroughness of the MSDR process against performance considerations?
   - Should we log all intermediate reasoning stages for all conversations or only for specific scenarios?
   - How much detail from the reasoning process should be exposed to users versus kept internal?
   - Should we implement specialized evaluation metrics for each reasoning stage?
   - Do we need to create diagnostic datasets specific to each reasoning stage?

6. **Zero-Shot vs. Few-Shot Approach**:
   - For which error categories should we use zero-shot learning versus few-shot learning?
   - How many examples should be included in few-shot prompts to optimize for both accuracy and performance?
   - Should we dynamically select between zero-shot and few-shot approaches based on error complexity?
   - How frequently should we update the few-shot examples based on real-world usage patterns?
   - Should we implement a progressive system that starts with zero-shot and falls back to few-shot when confidence is low?
   - What metrics should we use to evaluate when to switch between approaches?

7. **Rollout Strategy**: Should we deploy to all users at once or take a phased approach by region or user type?

8. **User Consent Approach**: How should we balance ease of use with security when requesting consent for system modifications?

9. **Metrics Collection**: What user interaction data should we collect to improve the system while respecting privacy?
